# Project TODO List

This file tracks pending tasks and items that need to be revisited.

- [ ] **Verify Docker Setup**: The Docker build failed due to a local authentication issue with Docker Desktop. Once the login issue is resolved, we need to:
  1. Run `docker build -t dermassist-api .` to confirm the image builds successfully.
  2. Run `docker-compose up` to confirm the full application stack (backend + redis) starts and runs correctly.
